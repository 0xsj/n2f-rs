# Status

## 2026-09-14 — Organization invitations and role transitions

The organization domain and application workflows are implemented and mirrored
across all three builds. O01–O10 cover validated organization names and times,
separate membership values, invitation lifecycle state, closed roles, explicit
initial-owner construction, history-preserving restore and snapshot ownership.
`CreateOrganization` and `InviteMember` use org-owned active-eligibility ports;
session admission and principal IDs remain composition-root concerns.

`cargo test --offline --test org_domain_spec --test org_app_spec`, `cargo check
--offline` and clippy with warnings denied passed. Migration 7 adds the membership
uniqueness key and invitation table. PostgreSQL locks actor/invitation/target rows
as appropriate: invitation creation enforces owner/admin policy, acceptance
atomically creates membership and marks the invite accepted, and role changes
allow owner→admin/member or admin→member while protecting self and owner targets.
The root-composed routes retain session, Origin, CSRF and principal-scoped GET
admission. The 58-step real-process verifier passes against PostgreSQL 18,
Mailpit and the live service: owner invitation, invitee acceptance, replay
refusal, promotion and admin/owner guards produce one organization row and two
memberships. `tools/org.http` and `tools/run_org_curls.py` provide editor and
curl workflows for the same routes.

## 2026-09-13 — WebSocket upgrade-ticket admission

The stage 8 WebSocket ticket slice is implemented, uncommitted and aligned in
all three builds. Migration 5 stores only a purpose-bound digest with a
30-second maximum lifetime. `POST /v1/auth/websocket-ticket` is session,
Origin and CSRF protected; the native upgrade boundary requires the session
cookie, allowed Origin, `n2f.v1` and one `n2f.ticket.<ticket>` value, then
atomically consumes the ticket while rechecking principal status, session and
auth epoch. The admitted socket receives only the safe principal projection;
identity retains the private session proof and revalidates it before each
authenticated message and every heartbeat, closing revoked/expired sockets.

`tools/verify_auth_http.py` passed end to end against PostgreSQL 18 and Mailpit
in Go, Rust and Nest: ticket issuance, 101 upgrade, ping/pong, single-use replay
refusal, logout/recovery, outbox counts and redaction. The same live run now
proves an already-open socket refuses its next message after HTTP logout. Go
compile/test discovery, Rust check/test compilation and Nest TypeScript checking
passed. Full ordinary suites remain subject to the existing sandbox loopback
restriction. A source/verifier redaction review found no additional
secret-bearing gap.

## 2026-09-13 — Shared Redis limiter and trusted proxy policy

Stage 7b is implemented, uncommitted. Root selects the existing AttemptLimiter
port's process-local adapter by default or the Redis adapter with AUTH_LIMITER.
The Redis path uses one atomic subject/source script, HMAC-derived digest fields,
bounded live state, expiry eviction and fail-closed dependency handling.
HTTP_TRUSTED_PROXIES is root-owned and only accepts forwarded chains from a
configured IP/CIDR peer; malformed chains fall back to the canonical peer.

tools/verify_limiter.py passed against PostgreSQL 18, Redis 8 and Mailpit with
two independent HTTP processes: ten distributed 401 login failures followed by
a shared 429. Redis state contained digest fields only and the limiter URL,
email, password and CSRF key were absent from process output. Cargo check,
formatting and the Rust build passed. The Nest RESP framing defect found during
the live comparison was corrected in its own build.

The selected live Redis mutation run caught 3/3 named faults (subject
threshold, raw-subject digest and boundary comparison) in an isolated copy.

Next: org application and persistence. Full ordinary-suite evidence remains.

## 2026-09-13 — Audit ingestion boundary and authenticated read route

The first audit slice of stage 8 is implemented, uncommitted. The shared
PostgreSQL mailbox now uses `(event_id, consumer)` receipts, and the root HTTP
process dispatches identity outbox facts and consumes them through either the
PostgreSQL path or the JetStream path selected at composition time. The audit
record and its receipt commit together; six identity event types are translated
without importing identity internals. `GET /v1/audit/records` is authenticated,
bounded to 1–100 records (default 50), and preserves occurred versus recorded
time. See [audit contract](src/domains/audit/CONTRACT.md).

`cargo check --offline` passed. The broader HTTP suite remains environment
blocked by denied loopback binds; the real process verifier
'tools/verify_audit.py' passed against PostgreSQL 18 and JetStream: the
authenticated read route, bounds, timestamps, redaction and three processed
audit receipts passed in both transport modes. The selected live audit mutation
run caught 3/3 named faults (timestamp replacement, receipt consumer scope and
action projection) in an isolated copy. The full ordinary suite remains.

## 2026-09-12 — Mail delivery completes the browser workflow

Completed the mail delivery half of stage 7 of the [auth build order](AUTHENTICATION.md).
An identity-owned SMTP adapter ([contract](src/domains/identity/infra/smtp/CONTRACT.md)) sends verification
and reset messages whose link carries the token only in the fragment, bounds each
attempt with one timeout, reports delivered only when the server accepts the
message, and logs one safe outcome per attempt. Root selects it when
`AUTH_SMTP_HOST` is set and keeps the undelivered adapter otherwise; a password
configured without a username refuses startup. Verification and reset requests
now withhold challenges and mail from a principal that is not active while still
answering accepted, so suspension is not disclosed.

Verified: `tools/verify_auth_http.py` now starts Mailpit beside PostgreSQL 18 and
walks the whole browser flow through this build's real process in 31 steps: one
verification mail; verification refused with a wrong password, accepted, then
refused on replay; login with the session cookie and no token in the body;
session, logout, and session refused; a reset request that mails a reset link and
an unknown-email request that mails nothing; the reset, the old password refused
and the new one accepted; outbox counts of one registration, one verification,
one logout revocation, one password change, one all-sessions revocation and two
session creations; and redaction of every mailed token and session cookie value.
Full ordinary suites and static checks passed. Six selected mutations (token in
query, delivered on rejection, timeout ignored, token in log, expiry omitted,
mail to a suspended principal) were caught in an isolated copy by
`tools/mutations/auth_mail.py`; not a score. See
[SMTP notes and evidence](notes/modules/src/domains/identity/infra/smtp/README.md).

Corrections worth retaining: lettre's relay builders pin ports 465 and 587, so the
adapter uses the explicit builder with the configured port and TLS mode. Its
per-command timeout does not bound a slow sequence of replies, so an outer tokio
timeout bounds the whole send, and only stretching the stored timeout makes that
mutation observable. Leaving lettre's pool feature off gives one connection per
message. Root first ignored a password supplied without a username; it now
detects presence from the raw lookup, before the settings reader records
anything, and refuses startup, with unit tests for the four cases.

Unverified: implicit TLS, STARTTLS and SMTP authentication against a real remote
server; the suspended-principal path through HTTP, since no suspension route
exists (the application spec covers it). There is no mail retry or durable mail
queue, as A15 allows. Next, in the agreed order: audit, with outbox dispatch and a
consumer lifecycle in the auth process; then the shared Redis limiter with a
trusted-proxy policy and a redaction review; then WebSocket upgrade tickets.

## 2026-09-12 — Login surface: HTTP extension, transport and root composition

Completed stage 6 of the [auth build order](AUTHENTICATION.md). The shared HTTP
boundary gained feature routes (H15–H19 of its contract): per-route methods with
a real Allow set, bounded raw bodies, selected headers, parsed cookies that keep
duplicates visible, a response value with allowlisted headers and Set-Cookie,
headers-carrying refusals, and a route admission step that runs after routing
and before the provenance scope opens, so an authenticated principal becomes the
scope's initiator. A shared keyed digest (HMAC-SHA256 over text keys) serves
CSRF signing and rate-limit subjects. The identity transport registers eleven
routes under `/v1/auth` with `__Host-` cookies, an exact origin allowlist, a
signed double-submit CSRF context bound to the session digest, strict JSON
decoding and enumeration-safe responses ([contract](src/domains/identity/transport/http/CONTRACT.md)). Local
adapters (process-local limiter, file blocklist, undelivered mail) let root
compose a runnable process per [AUTH_BUILD.md](AUTH_BUILD.md): `AUTH_ENABLED=true`
applies the ledger, wires store, hasher, codec, keyed digest, limiter, blocklist,
operations and transport, and prints a redacted manifest.

Verified: `tools/verify_auth_http.py` ran this build's real process against
PostgreSQL 18 through every step (manifest, CSRF issue, origin and CSRF
refusals, malformed and blocklisted bodies, register and duplicate 202,
identical login refusals, session 401, idempotent logout, 429 with Retry-After,
one outbox registration row, readiness, clean SIGTERM exit, redaction, completion
logs). Shared and identity suites, the full ordinary suite, the build's static
checks and the diagnostic HTTP verifier in mode none passed. Selected mutations:
seven for the HTTP extension and keyed digest (`tools/mutations/auth_http.py`)
and nine for the transport and local adapters
(`tools/mutations/auth_transport.py`), caught in isolated copies in every build,
48/48 across the comparison; not a score. See
[transport notes and evidence](notes/modules/src/domains/identity/transport/http/README.md), [local adapters](notes/modules/src/domains/identity/infra/local/README.md),
[keyed digest](notes/modules/src/shared/keyed/README.md), [feature routes](notes/modules/src/shared/http/feature-routes.md) and [root composition](notes/modules/src/root/auth-composition.md).

Corrections worth retaining: provenance fixes attribution at scope entry, so
session admission must precede Open, and a refused admission still opens an
`http.admission` scope. Refusals needed to be values carrying headers and
cookies (a 401 that clears the cookie, a 429 with Retry-After); the boundary
contract now records that extension. The keyed fixture generated from raw bytes
held a key no text-keyed language could construct; keys are UTF-8 text by
contract now. Logout answers 204 and cannot return the rotated CSRF token, so
clients fetch `GET /csrf` next. Strict JSON needed its own parsing where the
standard decoder keeps the last duplicate key silently.

No mail is delivered, so verification and login after verification cannot yet
complete from a browser; the rate limiter is process-local and the source key is
the peer address without a trusted-proxy policy. Stage 7, Mailpit delivery, the
shared Redis limiter, redaction review and the full browser workflow, is next.

## 2026-09-12 — Identity PostgreSQL store against the real database

Completed stage 5 of the [auth build order](AUTHENTICATION.md): the identity
migration and the concrete store behind every stage 4 port, under a
[local contract](src/domains/identity/infra/postgres/CONTRACT.md). Each mutation is one shared-package
transaction that locks auth state, principal, credential and then session or
challenge, rechecks under lock, writes with guarded updates and affected-row
checks, and enqueues its envelopes on the same transaction. Duplicate canonical
emails are recognized by constraint name inside the callback because the shared
error mapping redacts it afterwards; refusals that must roll back leave the
callback as a private marker and are settled to values after rollback; Resolve
learns a digest's owner unlocked, locks in order, re-reads, and latches an
observed expiry as the one refusal that commits.

Real PostgreSQL 18 checks passed in every build through the owned disposable
database of `tools/verify_identity_store.py`: register round trip with absent
timestamps, duplicate after rollback with no rows, eight-way same-email
registration with one winner, each stale login condition, admitted touch, idle
deadline equality, backward time, epoch mismatch, revoke-before-resolve, eight-way
challenge consumption with one winner, reissue invalidating an expired challenge,
stale verification, password change bumping the epoch and invalidating
challenges, reset setting verification, complete rollback on enqueue failure and
outbox rows without private data. Go 11 subtests, Rust one scenario target, Nest
15 cases; full ordinary suites, race/vet, clippy/fmt and lint/type/build (Node 24)
passed with the integration tests skipped or ignored. Six selected mutations per
build (duplicate as failure, stale login ignored, unguarded consume, backward
time admitted, unguarded revoke-all, dropped events) were caught against fresh
databases in isolated copies by the shared `tools/mutations/auth_store.py`,
18/18. Not a score. See [mirrored notes and evidence](notes/modules/src/domains/identity/infra/postgres/README.md).

Environment: Docker's VM disk filled during the run; unused images were pruned
(no volumes or containers) and the Nest and Rust builds first ran on a temporary
PostgreSQL 16 stand-in, then were rerun on PostgreSQL 18 once space returned. The
stand-ins are stopped. Uncertain commit is not reproduced; the store passes the
shared `database.commit_uncertain` classification through, and lock-order
deadlock freedom beyond the two eight-way races is not proven.

Root does not yet compose the store, hasher, codec or operations into a process;
no HTTP, cookie, CSRF, mail or rate-limit adapter exists. Stage 6, extending the
bounded HTTP surface and adding auth routes, is next.

## 2026-09-12 — Identity application operations against fakes

Completed stage 4 of the [auth build order](AUTHENTICATION.md): register,
verification request, email verification, login, authenticate, logout, logout-all,
password change, reset request and password reset as application operations under
a [local contract](src/domains/identity/app/CONTRACT.md). Every capability is a consumer-declared port
with explicit outcomes (created/duplicate, found/absent, committed/stale,
admitted/rejected/absent, delivered or not), one store adapter narrowed per
operation, and safe outbox envelopes built before the store call so the store owns
whether they apply. Post-commit mail never runs after a stale or uncertain commit;
refused attempts emit no event; unknown logins still pay the dummy verification.

Suites passed with fakes and recorded call order: the Go command and query
packages, 13 Rust tests and 29 Nest cases. Full ordinary suites, Go race/vet, Rust
clippy with warnings denied and fmt, and Nest lint/type/build under Node 24 passed.
Six selected mutations per build (enumeration leak, duplicate replaces credential,
mail after uncertain commit, verification without password proof, stale commit as
success, private data in an event) were caught in isolated copies by the shared
`tools/mutations/auth_app.py`, 18/18. Not a score. See
[mirrored notes and evidence](notes/modules/src/domains/identity/app/README.md).

Alignment worth retaining: Email is parsed before rate-limit admission because the
canonical email is the limiter subject, and token operations use the digest hex.
A Nest fake codec that ignored purpose hid exactly the confusion T03 forbids and
was fixed. Rust clippy's await-holding-lock check ignores explicit drops, so guarded
assertions are scoped. Principal status is enforced by the store recheck; the
builds' optional pre-checks differ and the contract now records that (U17). Rust's
common domain bounds became public for the application layer.

The transaction, lock and concurrency promises named per store port are stage 5
obligations. No PostgreSQL adapter, mail transport, rate limiter, HTTP or cookie
handling exists. Stage 5, migrations and concrete atomic operations, is next.

## 2026-09-12 — Password hashing and token codec adapters

Completed stage 3 of the [auth build order](AUTHENTICATION.md): identity-owned
PasswordHasher and TokenCodec adapters with local contracts
([hashing](src/domains/identity/password_hash/CONTRACT.md), [tokens](src/domains/identity/token_codec/CONTRACT.md)) and cross-language vectors
generated once and copied verbatim into each build. Argon2id v19, m=19456, t=2,
p=1 in PHC form; the read allowlist is exactly the write format, compared as text
before any hashing call; verification compares in constant time; an absent
credential runs the same work against a fixed dummy record; admission bounds
concurrency and queueing per adapter with saturation, queue-timeout and (Go/Node)
cancellation refusals, and admitted work completes past a deadline. Tokens are 32
entropy bytes as 43 canonical base64url characters, digested by SHA-256 over
purpose, a zero byte and the raw bytes.

Node 24's built-in `crypto.argon2` (per `.nvmrc`; `engines` added) reproduced the
Go-generated hashes. Rust added `argon2` 0.6.0 and `subtle` 2.6.1 and moved its
entropy capability from `id` into `shared::entropy` with re-exports. Go promoted
`golang.org/x/crypto` to a direct dependency.

Adapter suites passed: 11 Go tests, 15 Rust tests, 58 Nest cases. Full ordinary
suites, Go race/vet, Rust clippy with warnings denied and fmt, and Nest lint/type/
build checks passed under Node 24. Seven selected mutations per build (parameter
allowlist, mismatch as corruption, dummy leak, saturation, purpose binding,
non-canonical acceptance, entropy fallback) were caught in isolated copies by the
shared `tools/mutations/auth_adapters.py`, 21/21. These are targeted checks, not a
score. See [mirrored notes and evidence](notes/modules/src/domains/identity/adapter-mutation-evidence.json).

Corrections worth retaining: Go's strict base64url decoder and Rust's default
engine already reject non-zero trailing bits, so the contract's re-encode rule is
observable only with a permissive decode and is defense in depth there. Rust
current-thread tokio tests deadlock on std blocking waits; admission tests use the
multi-thread flavor. A hand-typed dummy record passed H05 because the comparison is
discarded; the specs now pin it to the fixture. The contracts gained Internal
`identity.hash_failed` for lost blocking work and now name the native test seams;
Rust cannot reach the T01/T06 refusals by construction.

Nothing consumes these adapters yet; no application operation, storage, HTTP,
mail or rate limiting exists. Stage 4, the application operations with fake
consumer-owned ports, is next.

## 2026-09-12 — Auth leaves implemented

Completed stage 2 of the [auth build order](AUTHENTICATION.md): the executable
leaf specs written this morning now pass in every build. Email, enrollment/login
password, token purpose/digest, credential, auth epoch, session and challenge are
pure values and transitions following the [leaf decisions](src/domains/identity/domain/AUTH_LEAF_SPEC.md);
the refusing scaffolds are deleted. Bounds, refusal classification and transition
order agree across the builds: revoke/invalidate before stored activity, bad clocks
and TTL overflow are Invalid; revoked, expired, backward, wrong-purpose,
stale-version and terminal use are Unauthenticated; Touch checks the session
before validating its TTL.

Auth suites passed: 13 Go tests over the 51 shared fixture cases, 12 Rust tests and
63 Nest cases. Full ordinary suites, Go race/vet, Rust clippy with warnings denied
and fmt, and Nest lint/type/build checks passed; explicit DB/broker tests were
skipped or ignored as before. Six selected mutations per build (expiry equality,
purpose confusion, replay, stale version, missing revocation check, secret
disclosure) were caught in isolated copies by the shared `tools/mutations/auth.py`,
18/18 across the comparison. These are implementation-visible targeted checks, not
a score. See [mirrored notes and evidence](notes/modules/src/domains/identity/domain/auth-leaves-walkthrough.md).

Corrections worth retaining: the Go red-stage helper compared the public error
type, which redacts Internal by design, so the credential-corruption case was
unsatisfiable until the helper switched to the diagnostic accessor. Nest's
`String.prototype.isWellFormed` passed under vitest but not the ES2023 type check
and was replaced by a code-point scan. Rust cannot exercise the malformed-UTF-8
fixture because `String` is valid by construction. Go made `golang.org/x/text` a
direct dependency and Rust added `unicode-normalization` 0.1.25 for NFC.

No hashing, token generation, application operations, persistence, HTTP, mail or
WebSocket behavior exists. Stage 3, the PasswordHasher and TokenCodec adapters, is next.

## 2026-09-12 — Built-in authentication contract

Corrected baseline scope: identity includes authentication, without an account/profile
prerequisite. Added A01–A24, native leaf/capability shapes, a logical schema and the
[staged acceptance plan](AUTHENTICATION.md). ADR 0011 records opaque revocable sessions,
identity-owned credentials and explicit post-commit mail/resend semantics.

The working first client is email/password with browser cookie sessions. Contracts
cover verification/recovery, bounded password hashing, token-purpose separation,
session expiry/revocation, version-guarded atomic writes, CSRF, authenticated
provenance, WebSocket checks and safe audit translation. These are specifications,
not implemented auth endpoints or executable auth tests.

Reviewed current OWASP/NIST primary guidance; sources are in the auth contract.
Common contract/API/schema content and local links were checked across the builds.
Runtime code and dependencies are unchanged; prior suites and mutation checks were
not rerun for this documentation-only stage. Module notes mirror the domain path.

## 2026-09-12 — Identity principal leaves

Defined identity/audit/org ownership and implemented identity I01–I07: human/service
principals, validated display names, owned snapshots, restoration and immutable
suspend/activate transitions with version/time guards. The initial slice provisions
principal values; credentials and sessions are deferred.

Four named leaf tests passed per build after behavioral failures against refusing
stubs. Four selected compiled mutations were caught per build; isolated baseline and
restored runs passed. These implementation-visible checks are not exhaustive.
Go race/vet, Rust clippy with warnings denied, and Nest type checks passed.
See [mirrored notes and evidence](notes/modules/src/domains/identity/domain/README.md).

A review exposed erased TypeScript constructor privacy: Reflect.construct bypassed
the static private constructor. A failing regression test preceded a current-state
validation fix. Go explicitly guards its zero principal; Rust's safe public API
prevents these malformed principal constructions.

Application commands/queries, atomic identity/outbox persistence, domain HTTP,
audit ingestion and org remain planned. The current HTTP adapter is diagnostic
GET/HEAD-only and discards request bodies; registration needs a deliberate contract
extension with bounded body access and an explicit provisioning admission policy.
No new database, broker or end-to-end workflow verification is claimed.

## 2026-09-11 — JetStream validates the publisher replacement

Added persistent NATS JetStream 2.14.6 to each independent Compose stack and a
concrete adapter behind the existing Publisher capability. The outbox dispatcher,
event envelope and database consumer transaction API remain unchanged. Root selects
`EVENTS_TRANSPORT=postgres|jetstream`; broker delivery is acknowledged only after a
matching durable PostgreSQL mailbox receipt. See [the run guide](JETSTREAM.md).

The effective Compose audit found 30 unique loopback TCP host ports: Go 71xx,
Nest 72xx, Rust 73xx. PostgreSQL remains 7120/7220/7320; NATS adds client ports
7122/7222/7322 and monitoring ports 7123/7223/7323. All three normal JetStream
containers are healthy and intentionally left running. Verification containers
are stopped, with their named volumes retained; other user containers are unchanged.

Real adapter/process checks passed for rolled-back enqueue, reclaimed outbox after
lost acknowledgement, PubAck deduplication, conflicting IDs, nondurable sink refusal
and redelivery, mailbox effect deduplication, a full 64 KiB envelope, closed publisher
retaining pending work, both root selections, incompatible-resource refusal, forced
broker recreation with persisted pending delivery, and outage/reopen. Safe logs omit
payload sentinels and connection strings. Full ordinary suites passed; explicit
DB/broker tests skip there and ran separately in the real verifier. Go race/vet,
Rust clippy with warnings denied, and Nest lint/type/build checks passed.

The real swap exposed a pull-subscription mismatch in Rust/Node request multiplexers,
header overhead at the envelope size boundary, and capacity reservations retained by
old fixture streams. These findings and language-specific ownership details are in
[mirrored notes](notes/modules/src/root/jetstream-verification.md). No new mutation score, clustered
availability, fanout, exactly-once, deployment authentication or broker OTLP claim.

## 2026-09-11 — Infrastructure before identity, audit and org

Completed validation/pagination, PostgreSQL, readiness, outbound HTTP, WebSockets
and events, in the requested leaf-first order. Contracts are local to each owner;
[the run guide](INFRASTRUCTURE_BUILD.md) describes the implemented diagnostics.
Publisher remains a replaceable durable-receipt seam, with a real PostgreSQL mailbox
adapter and explicit JetStream requirements. No domain was created.

Real PostgreSQL checks passed for migrations, rollback, uncertain-safe failure
mapping, concurrent writes, deadlines and close; event checks passed for duplicate
and conflicting reuse, wrong receipts, stale leases, poison retention, consumer
savepoint rollback, concurrent claims and a near-limit envelope roundtrip. The
compiled event example completed with safe logs. Database outage/recovery changed
readiness while liveness remained healthy; shutdown stayed within its budget.

All three builds passed the native outbound/socket process matrix. Stored outbound
CLIENT spans retain server parentage and propagated child context, and duration
metrics were retrieved. The existing sampled HTTP regression passed 48 requests,
48 completion logs and six invalid-config starts per build; its spans, logs and
metrics were retrieved again after the root changes. Prior unsampled/outage matrices
were not repeated in this pass.

Full ordinary suites passed. Rust offline locked tests, compile-fail doctests and clippy with warnings denied passed.
Six selected infrastructure mutations were caught per build (18/18 across the
comparison). These are implementation-visible targeted checks, not an exhaustive
mutation score. See [mirrored notes and evidence](notes/modules/src/root/infrastructure-verification.md).

Corrections worth retaining: SQLx commit receipt ambiguity needed a pre-commit
transaction usability check; Node cannot kill an arbitrary Promise on timeout;
Rust needed explicit oversized-frame closure; and jsonb output formatting could
expand a valid envelope past the wire budget. The final storage uses validated
text plus semantic JSON duplicate comparison. Dedicated socket/event OTLP signals,
broker fanout, NATS integration and business audit policy remain subsequent work.

## 2026-09-11 — HTTP and telemetry realigned and integrated

Completed the value/API corrections, shared outcomes, once-only request lifecycle,
protected trace logging, native HTTP adapters and bounded OTLP providers. Root now
owns diagnostic routes, provenance admission, explicit context, validated settings
and shared shutdown. Mirrored notes describe the language-specific choices.

The final comparison passed five modes with 48 requests and six invalid-config
starts each. Stored spans, trace/provenance-linked logs and duration metrics were
retrieved, including unsampled and post-recovery signals. Four selected mutations
per build were caught. See [verification](notes/modules/src/root/http-verification.md)
and the [run guide](TELEMETRY_HTTP.md). Older entries below describe historical stages.


## 2026-09-11 — Create HTTP core leaves

Implemented `src/shared/http` projection and completion leaves from H01–H08: owned public problems, status/title mapping, method normalization and exhaustive completion policy. The focused HTTP suite passes.

Framework ingress, correlation headers, request context, once-only observation,
trace logger binding, OTel providers and live HTTP/collector integration remain
pending. No framework dependency was added.

## 2026-09-11 — Implemented telemetry value leaves

Implemented `src/shared/telemetry` trace identity and outcome leaves from T01–T02:
private validated trace/span projections, owned snapshots, sampling preservation and
an exhaustive outcome enum. The telemetry spec suite has 3 tests and the full
Cargo suite passed offline with the locked dependency set.

T03–T12, SDK providers, HTTP observation and OTLP delivery remain pending.


## 2026-09-11 — Specify telemetry into HTTP, leaf first

Added [the slice plan](TELEMETRY_HTTP.md), telemetry T01–T12 and HTTP H01–H14
contracts, native API/leaf maps and portable completion facts. Native package/module
entries are documentation-only. ADR 0007 records request-completion and provider
ownership; prior accepted ADR bodies remain unchanged.

The specifications separate trace identity from provenance, retain explicit
failure presence across languages, define safe problem responses and bounded
request attributes, and assign completion one owner. Root must connect sanitized
logs to a real ingestion path and share service identity and a shutdown budget.
Notes mirror the full source paths; current architecture/observability inventories
were corrected to acknowledge implemented logging and provenance.

Rust formatting and rustdoc with warnings denied passed. The first rustdoc run
caught an unescaped URI placeholder interpreted as HTML; the common contract
was corrected with inline code formatting and the same check passed.
Documentation links resolved and the common contracts/completion shapes matched
across all three clones. Existing source/dependency hashes matched except the
Rust shared-module documentation declarations; no SDK dependency was added.

No new executable spec tests, behavioral implementation, mutation run, live HTTP
integration or application OTLP export/retrieval is claimed. Existing runtime tests
were not repeated for this documentation-only change. Next: public leaf tests,
implementation and selected mutations, then native adapters and real process checks.

## 2026-09-11 — Implemented process foundations

Implemented secret, captured env parsing, root-owned config, provenance values and
transitions, explicit log projections, console/JSON/no-op adapters and the named
foundations command. The shared contract preceded tests and implementations;
initial missing-surface failures are recorded distinctly from behavioral regressions.
ADR 0006 records logger projection and bounded delivery ownership before dependencies.

Rust/Cargo 1.86.0: 57 integration tests and 2 compile-fail doctests passed. cargo fmt --check, clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings, and rustdoc with -D warnings passed, using locked offline dependencies.

All eleven process scenarios passed, including actual pseudo-terminal auto-color,
redaction, malformed configuration, output severity and retry identity relations.
All 15 selected mutations were caught after successful builds; restored baselines
and copied/workspace hashes matched. These are selected faults, not an exhaustive
mutation score. No invalid or harness-failing mutation was counted as a catch.

Notes mirror full source directories, with walkthroughs, initial-red captures and
per-module mutation evidence. [Root verification](notes/modules/src/root/verification.md)
links the process report and actual JSON example. [FOUNDATIONS.md](FOUNDATIONS.md)
describes run commands, config defaults and remaining integration checkpoints.

No application OTLP export, remote secret provider, database/broker/socket adapter,
frontend compatibility or durable audit behavior is claimed. The Nest HTTP greeting
remains independent of this named example. No existing Compose resources were changed.


## 2026-09-11 — Identify the next leaves for the foundations demo

Added [FOUNDATIONS.md](FOUNDATIONS.md) with native file paths and dependency order:
secret value first, then env lookup/parsing and logger level/color policy;
reader/output adapters, provenance consumers, root config and demo wiring follow.
Runtime paths in that map are planned and have not been created as empty stubs.
The target uses actual foundations through no-op, colorized console and structured
outputs, including config validation, nested secret redaction, work/retry identity
and representative errors.

Added the [secret contract](src/shared/secret/CONTRACT.md) and native module docs.
S01–S10 define applicable leaf requirements; S11 is reserved for real logger
adapters. A constructed empty secret still redacts; config owns requiredness.
The [design note](notes/modules/src/shared/secret/redaction-and-requiredness.md)
records that boundary and why native formatting routes need separate checks.
Module notes retain the full 1:1 source-directory mapping.

cargo fmt --check passed. Rustdoc initially caught an unescaped generic type
in the included Markdown; after correcting it, the offline documentation build
passed with warnings denied.
Local documentation links, clone independence, matching secret contracts and
module-note ownership were checked. Existing runtime source, tests, dependency
files and Compose configuration are unchanged; Rust only registers the new
documentation module. No secret runtime APIs, executable spec tests, mutation
results or runnable demo are claimed. Application/infra suites were not rerun.
Next is the public secret specification test file identified in the file map,
followed by its value implementation.


## 2026-09-11 — Provenance contract and native API proposal

Specified all accepted additions in [src/shared/provenance](src/shared/provenance/README.md): workflow
attribution and per-execution executor, logical work versus fresh execution IDs,
start time, retries and replay, bounded additional causal links, operation names,
incoming-context disposition and WebSocket message boundaries. Prepared work has
no execution ID/time until execution starts. Restore operations validate complete
snapshots; accepting a correlation hint does not establish upstream attribution,
origin, hop count or authority.

The matching contract defines P01–P24 acceptance requirements, worked scenarios
and a native API proposal. These are not executable specification tests. Socket,
event, audit and projection requirements explicitly remain with later adapters.
Decision 0005 records the design. Design notes live under
[notes/modules/src/shared/provenance](notes/modules/src/shared/provenance/README.md), mirroring the source directory.

Rust documentation built offline with warnings denied; cargo fmt --check passed.
Documentation links and module-note paths were checked; the three contracts and
worked-scenario documents match. Existing implementation, tests, dependencies and
Compose files are unchanged, apart from Rust's documentation module registration.
No provenance runtime operations, executable spec tests or mutation checks have
been completed. Application and infrastructure suites were not rerun for this
documentation slice. Next is the executable leaf specification before implementation.


## 2026-09-11 — Clock and ID leaf foundations

Implemented separate [src/shared/clock](src/shared/clock/README.md) and
[src/shared/id](src/shared/id/README.md) modules after local contracts, native module docs
and public specification tests. Initial red runs stopped on missing APIs/imports;
those were build/import failures, not executed assertion failures. The same author
wrote the specs and implementation with reference visibility.

Clock separates wall timestamps from monotonic elapsed readings. Its fake allows
wall correction without changing elapsed time and refuses invalid advances before
mutation. IDs parse standard-variant UUIDs independently of generation version;
V7 uses injected wall time and OS entropy, a guarded counter and failure-atomic
state. Rollback holds the timestamp; exhaustion returns a classified refusal until
wall time advances. Sequence owns finite fixtures. Timers and transport/storage
integration remain future work.

`cargo fmt --check`, `cargo test --offline --locked`, all-target clippy with
warnings denied, rustdoc with warnings denied and the time_and_ids example passed
on Rust/Cargo 1.86.0. The integration suites contain 26 tests (6 clock, 9 ID,
11 errors). The compiled example printed the expected two IDs and 25ms.
getrandom 0.4.1, cfg-if and libc compiled on this macOS host; other targets,
including higher-MSRV target-specific lockfile entries, remain unverified.

The isolated mutation runner caught 9/9 selected valid faults in this clone,
25/25 across the three builds. Each counted mutant compiled and failed a named
runtime expectation. Baselines before/after passed; source/test/config hashes
confirmed restored copies and unchanged originals. This is targeted evidence,
not an exhaustive mutation score or independent test authoring.

The entropy consumer exposed a real error-API gap: an already boxed Error cannot
be passed through the existing generic source builder. Added with_boxed_source,
E11 and a targeted mutation, retaining the original concrete source for downcast.
See [the finding](notes/modules/src/shared/errors/boxed-sources.md).

Added language walkthroughs, initial-red records and mutation evidence under
`notes/modules/src/shared/clock/` and `notes/modules/src/shared/id/`, preserving the 1:1
source-directory mapping. Decision 0004 records the state and ordering policy.
Local documentation links and module-note ownership were checked. Infrastructure,
logger/provenance integration, persistence uniqueness and Flover compatibility
are not established by these leaf checks.


## 2026-09-11 — Module notes mirror their source directories

Moved the error module's six notes/evidence files under
[notes/modules/src/shared/errors/](notes/modules/src/shared/errors/README.md), matching
the repository-relative source directory exactly. Removed the redundant
errors- filename prefix and added a local module index.

Updated the notes guide and AGENTS.md with the directory-mirroring convention,
including nested owners and source roots. Rebased incoming links and all relative
links inside moved notes. Historical status entries and accepted decision records
received link-target repairs; their decision prose was preserved.

Verification: every module-note directory maps to an existing source directory;
all old flat note paths are gone and no stale filename references remain. Local
Markdown links resolve within their own clone. Moved note text is unchanged apart
from link targets; mutation evidence is byte-identical. Production, tests and
configuration hashes are unchanged, so application suites were not rerun.


## 2026-09-11 — Language review notes for the error foundation

Added a [code walkthrough](notes/modules/src/shared/errors/language-walkthrough.md), three
language notes and two reusable testing-technique notes. Topics cover enum/pattern/Result syntax; ownership, consuming builders and borrowed lifetimes; traits, dynamic sources, Send/Sync and generic context.
Each explanation connects syntax to the ownership or behavior it supports,
includes examples and gotchas, and links to primary documentation where relevant.

The walkthrough provides the local source/test links; transferable language and
technique notes stay independent of repository-specific paths. Updated the notes
index and errors implementation guide to make the reading order discoverable.
The testing notes explain public-interface scenarios, type checks versus runtime
assertions, mutation evidence and why preserved metadata keys need explicit tests.

Verification: extracted the complete worked program from each language's
walkthrough, compiled and ran all three, and compared stdout with the documented
output. Go used the local module, Rust an offline temporary consumer crate, and
TypeScript the installed compiler with strict NodeNext settings followed by Node.
All three matched. Checked local Markdown links and clone independence; the
shared technique copies match. Existing source, test and configuration hashes
are unchanged.

This was documentation work. Full application suites, infrastructure checks and
mutation runs were not repeated. Short declaration/method excerpts are explained
as fragments; the complete walkthrough programs are the examples executed here.


## 2026-09-11 — Mutation checks on the current errors implementation

Ran selected mutations in isolated temporary copies of the current implementation
and tests. This build caught 3/3 valid faults; the three builds caught 10/10
in total. Every counted mutant compiled and failed a named assertion. There were
no survivors or invalid mutants in the completed runs. Initial and restored
baselines passed, and source/test/configuration hashes confirmed the working
files were unchanged.

The added E10 case alone catches replacing fields instead of merging them in all
three languages. No implementation or test changes were needed. See the
[mutation findings](notes/modules/src/shared/errors/mutations.md) and
[machine-readable results](notes/modules/src/shared/errors/mutations.json) for exact edits,
failing cases and limits.

These selected checks are not an exhaustive mutation score. No infrastructure or
transport integration was exercised.


## 2026-09-11 — Align the errors implementations

Separated vocabulary, classification, owned failure, typed context and public
projection into private modules with the existing public exports preserved.
E10 now checks metadata collisions, source replacement and empty Type/message
behavior through context. It passed the existing implementation before the
refactor; this was regression coverage, not another red-to-green cycle.

Ten public-API integration tests pass. Clippy checked all targets with warnings
denied; rustdoc passed with warnings denied; cargo fmt passed. The runnable
registration example produces the same four public values as Go and Nest.

Each clone carries a local [implementation guide](src/shared/errors/README.md) with the
cross-language API comparison and a matching registration-refusal example.
The [consistency note](notes/modules/src/shared/errors/consistency.md) explains why public
fallback and classification are separate questions.

The common contract text is aligned across the three builds. Local Markdown
links were checked. No new dependencies or transport integrations were added;
HTTP/WebSocket encoding and Flover compatibility remain unverified. Earlier
targeted mutation results belong to the first slice and were not rerun here.
Infrastructure was not started.


## 2026-09-11 — First errors implementation through spec tests

Implemented [the first errors contract](src/shared/errors/CONTRACT.md) with shared scenarios
E01-E09 and language-specific ownership/inspection behavior.

Rust uses Classified and a borrowed Classification view for public meaning.
Context<E> retains the typed case, while Failure owns metadata and a boxed
Error + Send + Sync source. No Clone bound is imposed on sources and no domain
registry is needed.

The initial run compiled and all nine integration tests failed against placeholder behavior.

Nine public-API integration tests pass. Clippy checked all targets with warnings denied; rustdoc passed with warnings denied. The standalone errors example is included. Two valid targeted mutations were detected after separate
compilation checks, and the restored baseline passed. Formatting and local
documentation links were checked. See the
[TDD note](notes/modules/src/shared/errors/first-slice.md) for findings and limitations.

No new runtime dependency, logger, provenance, retry engine, transport adapter, HTTP
problem envelope or WebSocket error mapping was added. No database, broker or
frontend integration was verified. Existing infrastructure services were not
started for this pure error-value slice.

## 2026-09-11 — Draft errors module contract

Added [src/shared/errors/mod.rs](src/shared/errors/mod.rs) as a documentation-only
module and declared it under `shared` so rustdoc includes the contract. It mirrors
the Go draft's ten kinds, stable Type identifiers, public disclosure rules,
annotation/translation distinction, aggregate handling and recovery ownership.
Rust-specific guidance retains typed Result errors, explicit classification,
source chains and owned metadata. The trait/mapping and context/source APIs remain
proposed; no error types, functions, dependencies or behavior tests were added.

Updated navigation and recorded the
[Rust adaptation finding](notes/modules/src/shared/errors/rust-adaptation.md). Each clone
carries its own complete draft; there is no sibling source or documentation
dependency.

Verification on Rust 1.86.0, with build artifacts in a temporary target directory:

- `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo check --offline` passed.
- `cargo doc --offline --no-deps` passed with rustdoc warnings treated as errors;
  the generated errors module page contains the contract sections.
- `cargo test --offline` passed with zero unit tests and zero documentation tests.
  This establishes scaffold compilation, not error behavior.
- The ten kind names, order and definitions match the Go and NestJS drafts.
  Local links in the changed Markdown documentation resolve.

No runtime error handling, transport integration or frontend compatibility was
implemented or verified in this documentation pass.

## 2026-09-11 — Observability, mail, objects and selected interfaces

Expanded default Compose startup with Mailpit 1.31.1, SeaweedFS 4.46 in single-node
mini mode, and Grafana OTEL LGTM 0.32.1. Each has project-scoped persistence and
loopback ports. The telemetry health check probes live collector and store endpoints.
Mailpit captures SMTP locally. SeaweedFS initializes local S3 credentials and a
bucket; unused WebDAV, admin UI and table catalog endpoints are disabled.

Added [OBSERVABILITY.md](OBSERVABILITY.md) with the shared instrumentation
expectations and a standalone, standard-library Python OTLP probe. Updated the
architecture and decision records to select standard WebSocket, SMTP and S3
boundaries and to distinguish transactional outbox recording from replaceable
broker delivery. No application SDK or language dependency was added.

Verification on Docker 27.4.0 / Compose v2.31.0-desktop.2:

- All three Compose files resolved with defaults and example environment overrides.
- All 15 containers ran healthy together using the intended separate ports.
- Each stack captured a local SMTP message and accepted signed S3 PUT/GET requests.
  The distinct object contents matched their own blueprint; anonymous GET returned 403.
- Each blueprint's synthetic probe exported OTLP HTTP logs, metrics and traces.
  Authenticated Grafana data-source queries retrieved the trace, the log matching
  its trace ID, and the expected metric series from the respective stores.
- The first metric query failed because Prometheus normalized the name and appended
  a unit suffix. Inspecting the actual series resolved this; the probe output,
  guide and substrate note now use `n2f_infra_smoke_ratio`.
- Mail, object contents and all three telemetry signals remained retrievable after
  forced recreation of the three new services in every stack. This also verified
  the final SeaweedFS options with the table catalog endpoints disabled.
- Shell syntax, Python syntax/CLI help and documentation links were checked.
- Temporary `n2f-*-infra-check-20260911` containers, networks and all their volumes
  were removed. The regular development stacks are not left running.

The local integration harness was created with implementation visibility and is
not an independent or blind test. Docker/network checks required approved access
outside the sandbox. Language application suites were not repeated because their
code and dependencies were unchanged.

Not implemented or verified: application OTel SDKs, WebSocket endpoints, outbox or
JetStream delivery, infrastructure exporters, application dashboards/alerts,
profiling, collector outage behavior under application load, OTLP gRPC export,
S3 presigning/browser CORS, full S3 feature parity, crash recovery or deployment
hardening. Synthetic acceptance and retrieval demonstrate local infrastructure,
not application instrumentation or Flover integration.

## 2026-09-11 — Local PostgreSQL and Redis

Added independent `compose.yaml` and `.env.example` files with PostgreSQL 18.6
and Redis 8.10.1, loopback ports, readiness checks, project-scoped volumes,
Redis AOF, and bounded Docker logs. The equivalent setup in each n2f repository
uses its own default project name and host ports.

[INFRASTRUCTURE.md](INFRASTRUCTURE.md) records operation, reset behavior and
proposed next integrations. Added the local-infrastructure ownership decision and
a substrate note about PostgreSQL 18's versioned Docker data layout. The current
README and architecture distinguish running dependencies from implemented adapters.

Verification on Docker 27.4.0 and Compose v2.31.0-desktop.2:

- All three files resolved with defaults and with their `.env.example` files.
- All six services ran together and became healthy on their distinct loopback ports.
- PostgreSQL reported 18.6 and `/var/lib/postgresql/18/docker`; Redis reported 8.10.1.
- Authenticated PostgreSQL TCP writes and Redis writes succeeded. Each build stored
  a distinct marker, and every marker survived forced recreation of its containers.
- Inspection confirmed the PostgreSQL named volume covers the versioned data path.
- Disposable `n2f-*-verify-20260910-c1a7` projects, containers, networks and volumes
  were removed after checking. The normal development stacks were not left running.

The initial Docker socket check and one database check were refused by the sandbox;
rerunning with approved Docker access succeeded. Application code and dependencies
were unchanged, so language build/test suites were not repeated. No application
integration, crash recovery, database upgrade, backup/restore, events, socket
transport or telemetry pipeline was tested or implemented in this pass.

## 2026-09-10 — Initial scaffold

The n2f family starts with independent Go, NestJS and Rust directories. This
pass establishes module ownership and the notes/decision workflow. Current
runtime behavior and commands are documented in [README.md](README.md).

No product domain, shared logger, provenance module, persistence or authentication
has been added. Architecture rules and decision immutability are held by review.

Added a dependency-free library crate with `root`, `domains` and `shared` module
locations. There is no executable server. HTTP framework, async runtime and
persistence choices remain open.

Verification on Rust and Cargo 1.86.0:

- `cargo fmt --check` passed.
- `cargo check --offline` passed.
- `cargo test --offline` passed with zero unit tests and zero documentation tests.

These commands establish that the crate scaffold builds. They do not establish
application behavior, architecture enforcement or backend compatibility.
