# The native transport owns termination

**Origin:** real diagnostic HTTP runs, including 48 requests per process with
overlap, panic, deadline and disconnect fixtures, on 2026-09-11.

The adapter starts observation before selecting a registered route. Incoming
X-Request-ID is ignored; X-Correlation-ID is accepted only as one valid UUID.
Repeated/empty/malformed hints restart local correlation. The public executor is
the named service with explicit anonymous attribution. Traceparent admission is
independent and delegated to the SDK's W3C parser.

Axum routes return an owned Body. Its wrapper finalizes after body handoff or Drop,
so returning a Response alone does not log success before its body is consumed.
A task-local scope is installed around the owned handler future. The OTel adapter's
FutureExt::with_context activates SDK context for each poll and restores it before
yielding; holding a thread-local ContextGuard across await would contaminate tasks.
Timeout drops the owned future. We deliberately removed a spawned JoinHandle
approach because dropping the handle would detach work instead of canceling it.
Dropping a future stops polling; it does not roll back effects already performed.
Hyper HTTP/1 owns the 16 KiB header buffer and read deadline; root bounds connections
and drains them on shutdown.

The native callback establishes server-side handoff/completion, not client receipt.
Early disconnects may lack a final status. The examples do no persistence, so a
canceled response never claims rollback. Header parse failures before application
admission are native server behavior and have no fabricated provenance scope.
The contract covers bounded JSON, not streaming, upgrades or WebSocket ownership.

**Used in:** src/shared/http/axum/ and src/root/http; tools/verify_http.py.

A late review added a stalled-body scenario: handler timeouts begin after admission,
so they do not bound a client that stops sending its declared body. The native
boundary now owns a one-second body-read deadline and returns a safe 408. Node's
generic requestTimeout checks are not used as a substitute for that owned timer.
