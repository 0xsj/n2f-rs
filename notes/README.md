# Notes

Write what the code cannot explain, while the work is fresh. A useful note
preserves an alternative that lost, a failure mode, a surprising dependency
behavior, or reasoning that would otherwise have to be rediscovered.

Do not write a note just to describe a newly created folder.

## Clock and ID foundations

- [Clock walkthrough](modules/src/shared/clock/language-walkthrough.md): wall time,
  elapsed units, fake ownership and native syntax.
- [ID walkthrough](modules/src/shared/id/language-walkthrough.md): UUID values,
  explicit generation, failures and deterministic fixtures.
- [Clock mutations](modules/src/shared/clock/mutations.md) and
  [ID mutations](modules/src/shared/id/mutations.md): exact faults and observed results.


## Error foundation review

Start with [the Rust code walkthrough](modules/src/shared/errors/language-walkthrough.md)
for a reading order, links to the implementation and a worked example. The
language notes explain the syntax, the technique it supports and its gotchas:

1. [Enums, Results and pattern syntax](language/rust-enums-results-and-patterns.md).
2. [Owned builders and borrowed classification views](language/rust-owned-builders-and-borrowed-views.md).
3. [Traits, boxed sources and generic context](language/rust-traits-boxed-sources-and-context.md).

Two reusable testing notes capture the method and the concrete fixture lesson:

- [Specification tests and targeted mutations](techniques/specification-tests-and-targeted-mutations.md).
- [Metadata tests need distinct keys](techniques/metadata-tests-need-distinct-keys.md).

## Recorded findings

- [Mutation checks after the errors consistency refactor](modules/src/shared/errors/mutations.md)
  — selected faults caught, and the field-loss bug only E10 detects.

- [A common public shape still needs different absence semantics](modules/src/shared/errors/consistency.md)
  — preserving unknown failures while aligning the three public projections.

- [The first errors slice](modules/src/shared/errors/first-slice.md) — initial failing tests,
  implementation choices and targeted fault-check results.

- [A Rust source chain does not supply shared classification](modules/src/shared/errors/rust-adaptation.md)
  — reasoning behind the [draft errors contract](../src/shared/errors/mod.rs).

- [PostgreSQL 18 changed the Docker data-volume boundary](substrate/postgres-18-docker-volume-layout.md)
  — used by [compose.yaml](../compose.yaml).

- [OTLP metric names can change on ingestion](substrate/otlp-metric-names-change-on-ingestion.md)
  — used by the [synthetic probe](../tools/telemetry/smoke.py) and
  [retrieval guide](../OBSERVABILITY.md).

## Choose by lifespan

| Directory | What the finding is true of | When to revisit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `modules/<source-directory>/` | This implementation, mirroring its source directory | Its code or caller changes |
| `substrate/` | A dependency at a particular version | That dependency changes |
| `patterns/` | An architectural approach | Its assumptions change |
| `techniques/` | A broadly reusable method | New evidence contradicts it |
| `language/` | Language behavior | The language or toolchain changes |
| `concepts/` | A domain concept | The domain understanding changes |

A module note may link to a transferable note. Keep transferable notes independent
of repository-specific paths; put concrete usage links in the module note or a
local index. Package documentation can hold short module reasoning without a
second copy here.

## Module note paths

Use `notes/modules/<repository-relative source directory>/<topic>.md`.
Mirror the full directory path 1:1, including `pkg/`, `internal/` or `src/`;
do not flatten it into module-name filename prefixes. A note for a nested
domain, application, adapter or transport directory mirrors that narrower path.

The current error module maps like this:

| Source directory | Module notes |
| --- | --- |
| `src/shared/errors/` | [notes/modules/src/shared/errors/](modules/src/shared/errors/README.md) |

The module directory owns short topic filenames such as `first-slice.md`,
`language-walkthrough.md` and `mutations.md`. Keep associated evidence beside
its note and use a local README to navigate the module's documents. Rebase both
incoming links and links from the moved notes whenever the source owner moves.

Create directories when there are findings to record. A matching directory tree
does not require a note for every source file or empty copies of every code
directory. Reusable language and technique notes retain their separate categories.

## Shape

Use a descriptive filename, a title, and a one-sentence claim that adds something
to the title. Then record:

- **Origin:** what taught this, and whether it was observed, tested or read.
- **What and why:** the useful finding and the alternative or failure behind it.
- **Example:** the smallest useful demonstration, when needed.
- **Gotchas:** assumptions and limits.
- **Used in:** actual use; module notes name local files, transferable notes name
  the usage context without depending on one repository.
- **Related:** relevant notes, contracts or decisions.

Mark unsettled claims **WORKING**. Substrate notes name the dependency version,
verification date and primary source. Distinguish reading documentation from
measuring behavior.

Keep progress and command logs in [STATUS.md](../STATUS.md). Record consequential
choices in [decisions/](../decisions/README.md). Notes must not conceal unfinished
work behind a retrospective explanation.
