# WebSocket contract

W01: Root owns a finite transport endpoint with an exact allowed Origin and the
required subprotocol n2f.v1. Missing/repeated/wrong Origin or missing subprotocol
refuses admission. Maximum 64 admitted connections, including work still finishing.
No cookie/principal trust or tenant membership is inferred from the handshake.
W02: Text messages are UTF-8 JSON objects with exactly v,id,type,payload:
v is numeric 1, id is 1..64 ASCII letters/digits/underscore/hyphen, type is 1..64
lowercase letters/digits/dot/underscore, payload is a JSON object.
Maximum serialized message is 65536 bytes. Binary closes 1003; malformed envelope
closes 1008; message size violation closes 1009; internal handler failure closes 1011.
W03: Process one application message at a time per connection. Go/Rust use socket
backpressure; Node refuses overlapping application messages with 1013 instead of
an unbounded Promise queue. Handler and write have a 1000 ms budget. Handler
callbacks honor cancellation and cannot retain socket objects or start detached work.
A slow write closes the connection. No successful local write claims client processing.
W04: Ping every 15 seconds; lack of pong terminates by the following heartbeat
budget. Protocol adapters handle control frames. Shutdown refuses new upgrades,
closes admitted connections (1001 when a graceful close can be delivered), and
drains under the remaining root budget, then forces transport closure.
W05: Root opens a connection provenance scope; each admitted application message
opens child work with fresh work/scope IDs. Client message id is only an echo key,
never a trusted provenance ID. Connection scope is not an authenticated session.
Observation uses fixed operation names, close reason and byte/count facts; never
payloads, raw Origin, arbitrary message types or credentials as metric labels.
W06: Diagnostic ping replies pong with the echoed id and payload containing the
connection scope ID and fresh message scope ID. The adapter accepts a root-owned
session handler so domain message routing can replace the diagnostic behavior.
Real wire verification must cover admission, repeated messages, malformed/binary/
oversize frames, heartbeat control frames and shutdown with an open connection.
