# Provenance

An immutable execution/work model with explicit attribution, retries, replay,
incoming hints, validated restoration and bounded causal links.

- [Contract](CONTRACT.md): P01–P24 and ownership boundaries.
- [Native API](API.md) and [worked scenarios](SCENARIOS.md).

Core scenarios P01–P19/P23 have executable tests. Transport storage, WebSocket
propagation and durable audit remain later adapters (P20–P22/P24).

- [Module documentation](mod.rs).
- [Implementation notes](../../../notes/modules/src/shared/provenance/README.md).
- [Runnable foundations example](../../../FOUNDATIONS.md).
